# Housing-Price-Prediction

## About the Project
The two algorithms used in this project are Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression. Multiple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable. Polynomial regression is a special case of linear regression where we fit a polynomial equation on the data with a curvilinear relationship between the target variable and the independent variables. The target variable is the prce of the house.

## About the Dataset
The dataset used is USA Housing dataset that was taken from Kaggle. The dependent variable is the price of the house and the independent variables are Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg.
